# nytimes-article-search

This is a program I created using NYTimes API.

The program allows you to query NYTimes articles.

to start:
 enter in a search term,
 
select the timeframe you wish to search within by entering a start date and end date,

click submit.

after hitting submit it will load ten articles within the paramaters selected. They will be in the form of a button so when clicked it will take you to that original article.
